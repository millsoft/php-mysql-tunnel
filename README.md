# SQL Tunnel Soap Server/Client for PHP

### What is this?
Not every hoster allows to connect directly to MYSQL but allows a direct Web connection (Port 80). This script is the middleman between your app and some mysql database.
 
 ### How To use?
 See tests/testsoap.php for an example how to use this
 
 
 ### Thats all?
 yeah, for now thats all.. I don't want to make it complicated but I might add more features to it later. For now this is what I needed in one of my projects.
